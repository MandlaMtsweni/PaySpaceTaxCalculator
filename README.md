// Due to time i couldn't do as much i can, some stuff is missing like unit testing, but i have added integration test,
  the styling is not up to par as well, i'm writing this comments i know i can do much better given enough time.
  this work is only for two days, since i didn't get a chance to do it over the weekend. 
  
  Thank you
